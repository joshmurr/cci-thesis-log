The project log has served as a notebook to write up milestone moments; tangents I felt needed documenting; or even esoteric processes which I knew I would forget if I didn't write them down. The first few posts from early in the project are the latter. It's not the clearest trajectory through the project, but it was never going to be really.

This is best viewed online at `https://joshmurr.github.io/cci-thesis-log/project_log.html` although I've done what I can to make it readable and consistent in PDF format.

The final outcome is available here `https://learning-to-learn-to-see.netlify.app`

I hope it all makes sense!
