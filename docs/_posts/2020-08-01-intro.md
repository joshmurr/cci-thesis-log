The project log has served as a notebook to write up milestone moments; tangents I felt needed documenting; or esoteric processes which I knew I would forget if I didn't write them down. The first few posts from early in the project are the latter. It's not the clearest trajectory through the project, but it was never going to be really.

For the best viewing experience please first visit `https://joshmurr.github.io/cci-thesis-log/` where you'll see a small gallery of works; then click on `Project Log` in the menu or go to `https://joshmurr.github.io/cci-thesis-log/project_log.html` to find the online project log. The PDF version contains everything the online version does, but in place of any video or animation there are boring static images.

The final outcome is available here `https://learning-to-learn-to-see.netlify.app`

I hope it all makes sense!
