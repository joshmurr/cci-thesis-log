The final outcome of the thesis project. A TensorflowJS core is used to run inference on one of three custom models provided, which is wrapped in a bespoke WebGL wrapper to handle input pre-processing and displaying the output of the model to the browser. The models and the online platform combined acheive a framerate useable on most standard integrated GPUs.
